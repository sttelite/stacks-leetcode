Stack Problems â€“ LeetCode in C++
This repository contains my C++ solutions to LeetCode problems focused on stacks.
Each problem has:

A separate .md note with explanation, time & space complexity
Why?
To practice pointer manipulation, in-place changes, and edge case handling, skills in C++ and systems programming.

How to run
Each solution is a standalone .cpp file.
You can test with your own main() or integrate into a LeetCode-style runner.
